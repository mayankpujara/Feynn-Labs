# Global Mental Health Trends Analysis
This repository explores global trends in mental health disorders and leverages data visualization and machine learning techniques to gain insights into their prevalence and potential interrelationships.

## Key Functionalities

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes the prevalence of various mental disorders across different countries, highlighting potential geographical disparities and correlations between the disorders.
- Predictive Modeling: Utilizes a Random Forest Regressor to estimate depression prevalence based on other mental health indicators, demonstrating the potential for data-driven insights.

## Code Structure:

- dataset: Contains the dataset (Dataset Link)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/uncover-global-trends-in-mental-health-disorder].
- notebooks: Houses the Jupyter Notebook (Global Trends in Mental Health Disorder - Source Code.ipynb) that performs the analysis and visualizations.
- requirements.txt: Lists the required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, etc.).

## Dataset Description

This dataset contains informative data from countries across the globe about the prevalence of mental health disorders including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety disorders, drug use disorders, depression and alcohol use disorders. By providing this data in an easy to visualise format you can gain an insight into how these issues are impacting lives; allowing for a deeper understanding of these conditions and the implications.
